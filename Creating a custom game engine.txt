Creating a custom game engine is a complex but rewarding process. Hereâ€™s a detailed plan that builds on your existing work (ECS and half of a renderer API). This plan covers key areas and provides a structured approach to guide you through the development process.

### Phase 1: Core Systems

#### 1.1. **Entity Component System (ECS)**
- **Complete ECS Implementation**: Ensure your ECS is fully functional with support for creating, destroying, and managing entities and components.
- **System Management**: Implement a system manager to handle the update logic for different systems (e.g., rendering, physics, input).

#### 1.2. **Renderer API**
- **Complete Renderer API**: Finalize your rendering API, ensuring it supports basic rendering tasks (e.g., drawing meshes, handling shaders, managing textures).
- **Abstract Rendering Layer**: Create an abstraction layer for rendering to support multiple graphics APIs (OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX).

### Phase 2: Additional Core Systems

#### 2.1. **Window and Input Handling**
- **Window Management**: Implement a window management system using a library like GLFW or SDL.
- **Input Handling**: Develop a robust input system to capture keyboard, mouse, and gamepad inputs.

#### 2.2. **Math Library**
- **Mathematics Utilities**: Develop a math library or integrate an existing one (e.g., GLM) for vectors, matrices, and other math operations.

### Phase 3: Graphics and Rendering Enhancements

#### 3.1. **2D and 3D Rendering**
- **2D Rendering**: Implement 2D rendering capabilities (e.g., sprites, text).
- **3D Rendering**: Develop 3D rendering features (e.g., model loading, camera systems, lighting).

#### 3.2. **Shaders and Materials**
- **Shader Management**: Create a system to manage and compile shaders.
- **Material System**: Develop a material system to handle different surface properties.

#### 3.3. **Scene Management**
- **Scene Graph**: Implement a scene graph or spatial partitioning system to manage objects in the scene.
- **Scene Serialization**: Develop functionality to save and load scenes.

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

#### 4.1. **Physics and Collision**
- **Physics Engine**: Integrate a physics engine like Bullet or Box2D, or develop a custom one.
- **Collision Detection**: Implement collision detection and response systems.

#### 4.2. **Audio**
- **Audio System**: Integrate an audio library like OpenAL or FMOD for sound effects and music.

#### 4.3. **Scripting**
- **Scripting Integration**: Integrate a scripting language (e.g., Lua, Python) for game logic and extendability.

### Phase 5: Tooling and Optimization

#### 5.1. **Editor Tools**
- **Level Editor**: Develop a level editor for creating and editing game worlds.
- **Asset Pipeline**: Implement an asset pipeline for importing and managing game assets (models, textures, sounds).

#### 5.2. **Optimization**
- **Performance Profiling**: Integrate tools for performance profiling and debugging.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Implement optimization techniques (e.g., frustum culling, level of detail).

### Phase 6: Finalization and Documentation

#### 6.1. **Testing and Debugging**
- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for core systems.
- **Integration Testing**: Perform integration testing to ensure all systems work together seamlessly.

#### 6.2. **Documentation**
- **Code Documentation**: Document the codebase thoroughly.
- **User Guides**: Create user guides and tutorials for using the engine.

#### 6.3. **Release and Maintenance**
- **Release Plan**: Plan for alpha, beta, and final releases.
- **Maintenance**: Establish a maintenance plan for bug fixes and feature updates.

### Execution Plan

1. **Define Milestones**: Break down the phases into smaller, achievable milestones.
2. **Prioritize Tasks**: Prioritize tasks based on dependencies and importance.
3. **Allocate Resources**: Allocate time and resources to each task.
4. **Regular Reviews**: Conduct regular reviews to track progress and make necessary adjustments.

By following this structured plan, you can systematically develop your custom game engine, ensuring that each critical component is thoroughly planned and implemented.
